## Plan

1. Remove outliers from equation-error method before performing fit!!
2. Read chapter 4 in Simmons master. This work contains a lot of good information!
3. Fit output-error lon model based purely on 211 pitch maneuvers. Only let params change 5%.
4. Investigate distributions of parameters
5. If things are looking good, continue to fitting lateral parameters only to 211 roll and 211 yaw maneuvers. Only let params change 5%.
6. Investigate distributions of parameters
7. If things look good, finished?
8. If things are not working, go back to data. Is the data clean? Look atWhat is wron all maneuvers.
9. Fit full model to all maneuvers again? Only let params change 2%?
10. Evaluate performance.
