# VTOL UAV System Identification

**If you use any of this, please cite the original thesis:**

**If you are looking for the Babyshark 260 VTOL UAV model, it is implemented here**: [Dynamic Model of the Foxtech Babyshark 260 VTOL UAV](https://github.com/bernhardpg/babyshark_vtol_model)

This repo is made publically available for future reference for work on system identification or further modelling of the Babyshark VTOL. This repo is not written to be used as a library in itself, although it does provide implementations of all the methods used in the system identification of the Babyshark VTOL UAV.
